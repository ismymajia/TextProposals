Model: [DictNet VGG](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45812668/dictnet_vgg/dictnet_vgg.caffemodel): Very large convolutional neural network to perform word recognition on pre-segmented word images, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. The network is trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. 

The model has been imported to work with Caffe from the [original model](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/text/) trained using MatConvNet library.

If you find this model useful, please add suitable reference to the paper in your work.
